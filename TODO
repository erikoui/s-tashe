convert chan-downloader to a module
password authentication
register page
user priviledge levels
check if file exists on cloud before uploading (also check database records and add them if missing)
rate limiter file uploads because they time out on slow connection

Automatically delete pics after uploading

Load images based by tag
  -> also SFW mode (sfw tag)

check why this happens when downloading a thread: couldnt tag picture: error: duplicate key value violates unique constraint "picture_tag_id"
  -> this is when a tag appears twice in the thread title. solution is to use a set for tagids instead of an array.
