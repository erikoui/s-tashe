The website where we stash some pics. Also we rate them. Also we tag them. Also we may be using incognito mode.

# the idea
ok so the site archives images from 4chan, and tags them using some keywords from the thread title. the site's users can vote on the tags to classify the images. users can also browse by tag, which also allows them to rate pictures by comparing two random ones. the more people rate, the higher their rank, which gives them more power, e.g. editing metadata, weighted rating and even uploading pictures, similar to stackoverflow or newgrounds. images are rated by votes/views system, until some better alternative is found.
